README for C# Loops and Power Calculation Code
Overview
This C# program demonstrates various looping constructs (while, do-while, and for loops) and includes examples for basic arithmetic operations, such as calculating powers and summing user inputs. The primary purpose is to illustrate how to use loops effectively in C# and gather user input for calculations.

Code Structure
The code consists of several methods, each demonstrating a different concept related to loops and user input:

1. labExample1()
Purpose: Demonstrates a while loop.
Functionality: Increments a number from 0 to 5 and prints the current number in each iteration.
2. labExample2()
Purpose: Demonstrates a do-while loop.
Functionality: Increments a number and calculates the cumulative sum, printing the current number and sum until the number exceeds 5.
3. labExample3()
Purpose: Demonstrates a for loop.
Functionality: Iterates from 0 to 9, but increments i twice in each iteration, resulting in output every second number.
4. labExcercise1Que()
Purpose: Collects five numbers from the user and performs cumulative addition.
Functionality: Prompts the user for five numbers and shows how each number contributes to the cumulative sum.
5. labExcercise1()
Purpose: Similar to labExcercise1Que(), but directly collects five inputs and calculates the sum.
Functionality: Prompts the user for five numbers and prints the cumulative sum after each input.
6. labExcercise2()
Purpose: Demonstrates a dynamic loop based on user input.
Functionality: Asks the user how many numbers they want to input and calculates the cumulative sum accordingly.
7. labExercise3()
Purpose: Similar to labExcercise1(), but specifically designed for five iterations.
Functionality: Collects five numbers from the user and calculates their cumulative sum.
8. labSessionAssI()
Purpose: Combines power calculation and checking for even/odd numbers.
Functionality:
Prompts the user for a base number and a power number, validating input.
Calculates and displays the result of raising the base to the power.
Collects ten numbers from the user and determines whether each is even or odd.
Key Concepts
Loops: Demonstrated through while, do-while, and for constructs to manage repeated actions based on conditions.
User Input: Uses Console.ReadLine() and Convert.ToInt32() to gather and convert user input into integers.
Power Calculation: Utilizes Math.Pow() to compute the result of raising one number to the power of another.
Even/Odd Check: Implements a simple conditional check to classify numbers.
Usage
Setup: Open a C# development environment (e.g., Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code).
Create a New Project: Set up a new C# console application.
Copy the Code: Paste the provided code into the main program file (e.g., Program.cs).
Run the Application: Execute the program and follow the prompts to test various functionalities.
Conclusion
This program serves as an educational tool to understand basic C# loop constructs, user input handling, and simple mathematical operations. It provides a hands-on approach to learning fundamental programming concepts.

Feel free to modify the code to explore additional functionalities or improve the user interface!
